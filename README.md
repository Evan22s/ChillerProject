# ChillerProject
HVAC Chiller Project CAP

This project predicts chiilled water enrgy consumption in a building using environmental and operational data. The goal is to help building operators forecase energy usage and optimize chiller operations.

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

install using 
- pip install

Dataset
- ['Chilled Water Rate (L/sec)',
     'Cooling Water Temperature (C)',
     'Building Load (RT)',
     'Outside Temperature (F)',
     'Dew Point (F)',
     'Humidity (%)',
     'Wind Speed (mph)',
     'Pressure (in)',
     'Hour',
     'DayOfWeek',
     'month']]
